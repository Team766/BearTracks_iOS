# BearTracks iOS App 

The BearTracks iOS app is the mobile companion to the BearTracks Web App that includes....

- **Person/Profile View** to manage the profiles of Students, Mentors, and Parents.
  - **Calendar/Event View** to create and view both Public and Private team events.
  - **Role View** to track Students and their roles on the team.
  - And much, much more! (eventually)

BearTracks is designed with one goal in mind: unify the various disparate services [Team766](https://github.com/Team766) currently uses to manage team activities.

All planned functionality is described in detail in the [BearTracks Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YwoPhR5z9TQzE_1sbPWpjJMYqRqwcFu4JrF9E7geR8g/edit).
